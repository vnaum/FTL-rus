msgid "You try your best but one stray rock hits a key structure in their ship.  It breaks apart in front of your eyes.  You salvage what you can before leaving, and try not to think about the lost crew."
msgstr ""
msgid "Despite your best efforts, the civilian ship breaks apart from the constant barrage.  You are barely able to break out of the asteroid field yourself.  The ship sustains some damage in the process."

msgstr ""
msgid "The drone keeps the ship stable enough to allow them to escape the asteroid field.  They message you with map coordinates, \"You're that Federation ship the Rebels are after, aren't you?  I can't offer much but I heard there was a Federation loyalist base nearby. Maybe they can help you?\""
msgstr ""
msgid "They reluctantly agree.  Once aboard, you watch as their ship crashes against a massive rock.  They thank you, but say \"I don't know what we'll do without our ship.  As the Captain, I feel obligated to help you with your mission.\""
msgstr ""
msgid "They refuse at first, but after another blast rocks their ship they agree and beam aboard your ship.  They say, \"Thank you but we really should return to our families...  I'm sure we can muster up a reward if you take us home.\""

msgstr ""
msgid "Destroy and loot the ship. They're just pirates."

msgid "(Beam Weapon) Carefully cut the ship out."

msgstr ""
msgid "(Beam Drone) Have your drone cut the ship out."
msgstr ""
msgid "You program the drone to work carefully around the trapped ship. In a short time it allows the ship to easily slip out of its cage. They thank you and offer some of the resources they have collected."
msgstr ""
msgid "You take a few careful shots but you expose a mineral patch in the rock that reacts violently with your weapon. A shockwave forces you back as debris pelts against your hull. When you regain control you find there is not much left of the ship."
msgstr ""
msgid "You fire a few volleys into the rock and it starts to shudder and break apart. Without shields the pirate ship takes a beating but eventually pulls free. They thank you for your assistance."
msgstr ""
msgid "You decide the pirate is not worth saving and fire a few volleys into their hull causing the ship to depressurize and break apart. You move in to loot the remains."
msgstr ""
msgid "You decide the pirate is not worth saving and fire a few volleys into their hull. Before you can scrap the remains another pirate ship flashes on your radar. Perhaps they saw your deed, or perhaps they want to claim the spoils for themselves, but for whatever reason, they're charging weapons!"

msgstr ""
msgid "(Boarding Drone) Launch a boarding drone into the station."
msgstr ""
msgid "You launch the drone and it crashes through their hull, leaving a huge breach. You watch as the drone tears through the creatures while debris and dead bodies fly out of the breach. The owners of the station are less than effusive when they thank you, and offer only a meager payment. Maybe it's a good time to leave..."
msgstr ""
msgid "(Bio Beam) Use the beam to pick off the spiders."

msgstr ""
msgid "Your crew boards the station, cautiously moving between corridors. Suddenly a man-sized arachnid bursts from a vent in the ceiling, followed by countless more. You fight your way back to the airlock and are forced to leave before accounting for all crew members. Not everybody made it back."
msgstr ""
msgid "Your crew slowly creeps up on a cluster of the creatures from behind. Without warning, the giant arachnids turn and charge. However, your team stays in control and before long you've beaten them back."
msgstr ""
msgid "Contact the station owners."
msgstr ""
msgid "They are thrilled with your success and offer you a reward."
msgstr ""
msgid "You fire a few volleys from a distance and it is clear the defense system is no match for your weapons. However, the station does not seem happy with your 'solution'. You salvage what you can and jump before there is trouble."
msgstr ""
msgid "You fire a few volleys but aren't able to penetrate the defense system's shields. Its weapons have no trouble piercing yours though, and you take minor damage before escaping. The station will need to find help elsewhere."
msgstr ""
msgid "The distress signal is coming from a small space station orbiting an uninhabited planet. Their satellite defense system has gone haywire and their repair crew can't approach without being fired on. They're looking for help to fix or disable it."

msgid "You can't help them so you prepare to move on."

msgid "(Ion Weapon) Disable the defense system"

msgstr ""
msgid "(Cloaking) Use your cloaking to disable the system."

msgstr ""
msgid "(Engi Crew) Remotely repair its targeting system."
msgstr ""
msgid "Your crew-member is able to remotely fix the glitch in the defense AI, allowing the repair crew to close in and finish the job. The station gives you its thanks along with a reward."
msgstr ""
msgid "You find the source of the distress call, a small research station. It appears a small laboratory fire got out of control and is threatening to destroy the station. Their fire suppression system is not responding."

msgid "You coldly shut off communications and prepare to leave. Your crew seems upset but you assure them that nothing could have been done."
msgstr ""
msgid "(Rock Crew) Send your Rock crew-member in."
msgstr ""
msgid "Your Rock soldier tears through the airlock directly into the fire. You've never seen someone that large move that fast. It disperses as much fire suppressant as possible into the heart of the blaze and eventually the fires start to die down."
msgstr ""
msgid "Contact the survivors."
msgstr ""
msgid "With most of the fire under control, the scientists are able to help secure the station. They offer you their sincere gratitude and a generous reward."
msgstr ""
msgid "(Repair Drone) Send your repair drone into the fire."
msgstr ""
msgid "You send the repair drone in and it methodically puts out the fires. Once it has made some progress, the rest of your crew helps to secure the station."
msgstr ""
msgid "They offer you their sincere gratitude; the station would have surely been destroyed without your assistance. They transfer a small reward and an additional drone schematic."
msgstr ""
msgid "You send your crew into the station. Unfortunately as soon as they enter the fire breaches the station's fuel cell containment. You quickly try to dock and retrieve your crew but not before an unfortunate soul is lost in the inferno."

msgid "You locate the highest concentration of life forms and bring the ship alongside the station. Before you can begin to offload the survivors a huge blast splits the station apart. Your ship is thrown away and some debris pierces your hull. You watch helplessly as the last of the survivors are consumed in the collapse of the station."
