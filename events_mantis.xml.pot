msgid "Upon arriving at the beacon, you're hailed by a well-spoken Mantis, \"Hail, traveler.  These are dangerous times.  Perhaps you find yourself in need of our services?\"  He appears to be a trader."
msgstr ""
msgid "Uncertain about what you'll discover at this beacon, you scan the surroundings.   You detect several warnings on wide-band channels discouraging any violence in protected trade-space.  Perhaps you can find some wares nearby."
msgstr ""
msgid "Merchants are not highly respected among the Mantis race, so few undertake the profession.  You're mildly surprised to receive an advertisement from a nearby space dock.  You decide to see what they have to offer."
msgstr ""
msgid "Identifying a Mantis trading post ahead, you signal them so that your approach won't be taken as a threat. The leader hails you: \"You have scrap? Quickly, come dock before the warriors see you.\""

msgid "At this point you almost expect a fight with the Mantis, but this beacon appears to be entirely devoid of other ships.   You take the time to catch your breath and double check the ship's systems."

msgid "A nearby Mantis mining operation is clearly using heavy Engi slave labor.  You briefly consider the possibility of emancipating the slaves, but the Mantis presence is too formidable.  You decide to lay low."
msgstr ""
msgid "There aren't so many parts of Mantis space that aren't dotted by the wrecks of battles past, but this is one of them. You take a deep breath and prepare to move on."

msgid "Accept."
msgstr ""
msgid "KazaaakplethKilik joins your crew, offers the coordinates for a nearby stash of stolen military goods and transmits the coordinates for a custom cruiser he has been working on.  You forward it to the Federation, sure they can make good use of it."
