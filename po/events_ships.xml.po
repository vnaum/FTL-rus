msgid "Continue..."
msgstr ""
msgid "The pirate explodes, leaving behind a substantial collection of useful scrap material. You go to examine the ship you just saved."

msgid "Continue fighting the pirate."
msgstr ""
msgid "It's best you finish this - but you wonder whether what the pirate is carrying will be as valuable as what the Slugs snuck off with."
msgstr ""
msgid "Let the pirate escape and go after the Slugman ship."
msgstr ""
msgid "The pirate's too badly damaged to pursue you and you catch up to the Slugmen before they jump. \"Ah, of courssse, we would never leave without providing the agreed upon ssspoils.\" They transfer over a decent chunk of the profits and set off."
msgstr ""
msgid "With the pirate defeated you scan the debris for anything useful. The Slug ship is long gone, spoils from the cache in hand."

msgstr ""
msgid "Their ship breaks apart and you feel relief in the knowledge that you will hopefully still be one step ahead of the fleet."
msgstr ""
msgid "Careful! Sensors indicate that this automated ship is rigged to inform the fleet of your location if destroyed! It is better to avoid risk and leave it alone, otherwise the fleet will find you faster within this Sector."

msgid "As soon as they see you, they power up their engines to jump away.  Stop them!"
msgstr ""
msgid "With the ship gone you search through the abandoned base for any signs of their destination but find none."
msgstr ""
msgid "You take what you can from the debris."
msgstr ""
msgid "A quick search of their communication logs shows that the tech you were searching for never passed through this base... It must have been a decoy! You strip what you can and prepare to jump."

msgstr ""
msgid "The Rock ship starts to power up their FTL drive. If we're going to earn their trust we must endure the heat for as long as they can!"
msgstr ""
msgid "As they jump away they relay coordinates to your navigation system. They must mean for you to follow them!"
msgstr ""
msgid "Their ship breaks apart and you feel a twinge of guilt. Perhaps they could have helped the Federation if this had gone another way. You scrap what you can and prepare to jump out of the heat."

msgstr ""
msgid "With the Slugs no longer a threat, you strip the ship and return to the Rockmen."

msgid "You power down your weapons and after a time the ship slowly limps away. They refuse all communications. You can't help but feel somewhat guilty."
msgstr ""
msgid "You can't help but feel somewhat guilty as you search through the debris. It was probably a trap... right?"
msgstr ""
msgid "You begin to strip their ship and don't find anything that would indicate they were on anything other than a peaceful mission. Perhaps you were too hasty."
