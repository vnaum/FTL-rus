msgid "As you are keeping a low profile, you're certain that the Rebel fleet is having a hard time tracking your ship."
msgstr ""
msgid "Since your distress beacon has not been activated, you feel confident that the Rebel fleet is having difficulty tracking you.  It should buy you a little time."
msgstr ""
msgid "Long range scanners indicate the Rebel fleet has temporarily paused its advance on your position. Your decision to leave the distress beacon deactivated was farsighted."
msgstr ""
msgid "Scanners show that the Rebel fleet has ceased its pursuit for a short time."
msgstr ""
msgid "Your intuition as captain is telling you that the Rebels are having a hard time trying to find your ship."
msgstr ""
msgid "Without a distress beacon or any FTL signatures to trace, you're sure that the Rebels are struggling to find you.  You can only hope their confusion lasts until more fuel can be found."
msgstr ""
msgid "The Rebel fleet seems to be unable to locate your ship's signature.  If only you could get some fuel, you might still have a chance to place some distance between you and them..."

msgid "A freighter suddenly arrives nearby. They are so close you can almost wave at them, but your hails are ignored and the ship quickly jumps away."
msgstr ""
msgid "Small traffic passes within a short distance of you, but no one responds to your hails."
msgstr ""
msgid "The only ship within hailing range appears to be a civilian vessel. However, it quickly leaves once it picks up your signal."
msgstr ""
msgid "As you wait, a small asteroid storm pelts softly against your shields and hull."
msgstr ""
msgid "You begin to wonder if turning on the beacon would be worth the risk of detection.  The fleet slowly approaches."
msgstr ""
msgid "You contemplate the vastness of space."
msgstr ""
msgid "The prolonged wait in empty space is causing tension among the crew. Still no contact."
msgstr ""
msgid "Cabin fever begins to spread among your crew."

msgid "Respectfully decline."

msgid "A merchant ship jumps into the sector and you quickly hail them asking for help.  They respond, \"Perhaps we could work out an exchange...\""

msgid "A number of ships pass through the sector.  You relay your message to each, and one finally responds.  \"I can't help much right now but perhaps we can trade.\""
msgstr ""
msgid "A nearby settlement sends a small ship in your direction.  It keeps its distance and hails you, \"We can give you fuel for a price.  Just don't even think of doing anything rash.  We've got a teleporter at our base and a squad ready to defend us."
msgstr ""
msgid "A large caravan of merchant ships jumps to a location near your position.  Sensing an opportunity, one ship breaks off from the fleet to offer you an exchange."
msgstr ""
msgid "A modified YT-1300 freighter jumps to an area near your sector.  Your gut tells you these people are smugglers, but they seem to be feeling altruistic and present an offer of assistance."
msgstr ""
msgid "Although your lack of fuel cells prevents your ship from jumping, you can still use your impulse engines.  Will you spend some time exploring the nearby system?"
msgstr ""
msgid "Explore the nearby area."

msgid "Stay near the beacon."
msgstr ""
msgid "You happen across a small asteroid field near the beacon."
msgstr ""
msgid "Approach the asteroid field to scan it."
msgstr ""
msgid "Avoid the risk."
msgstr ""
msgid "You find a small outpost for local travelers, but it seems few ships in this area employ FTL drives. Their stock of fuel cells is small and their price high, but beggars can't be choosers..."
msgstr ""
msgid "Trade 20 scrap for 5 fuel."
msgstr ""
msgid "You gladly make the trade."

msgstr ""
msgid "Don't make a trade."
msgstr ""
msgid "No ships respond to your hails and you find nothing of interest."

msgstr ""
msgid "(Advanced Sensors) Run a detailed scan with your sensors before responding."

msgstr ""
msgid "As their ship pulls up next to yours, their captain continues, \"Yes, we'll certainly help...  Help to relieve you of that nice ship!\"  Sensors detect a hidden teleporter has been activated.  We've been boarded!"
msgstr ""
msgid "As they approach, you detect their weapons powering up.  It seems their intentions are hostile!"
msgstr ""
msgid "\"I assure you that we mean no harm.  See, we'll send some fuel over on a transport.\"  A small ship docks and offloads some fuel just as they said.  They leave, saying, \"Stay cautious, friend.\""
msgstr ""
msgid "\"No one trusts anyone these days...\"  The ship jumps away."
msgstr ""
msgid "They reply,\"Keep our distance?  Let's see if you can stop us!\"  They power up their weapons and advance."
msgstr ""
msgid "Sensors indicate their ship is without military-grade weaponry, even small arms.  You allow them to dock and they give you some fuel saying, \"I remember a time when we didn't have to be so paranoid about each others intentions... Stay safe.\""
msgstr ""
msgid "Sensors are picking up armed crew and considerably more weaponry than is legal for a craft of this size.  This is surely a trap."
msgstr ""
msgid "Power up weapons and prepare for a fight."
msgstr ""
msgid "(Cloaking) Cloak and get out of scanning range before they have a chance to lock on."
msgstr ""
msgid "Your highly advanced cloaking system allows you to get out of range easily since they were still out of firing range.  Eventually the ship jumps away."
msgstr ""
msgid "The Rebel fleet seems to be unable to locate your ship's signature.  If only you could get some fuel, you might still have a chance to place some distance between you and the Rebels..."
msgstr ""
msgid "You contemplate that it is fortunate the ship's life support system does not rely on FTL fuel cells."
msgstr ""
msgid "Nothing happens.  Your calls go unanswered."
msgstr ""
msgid "The distress beacon's light is the only movement visible outside the ship."

msgid "A ship arrives at the beacon.  \"We noticed your distress signal.  I assume you're out of fuel?  We're a bit low ourselves but perhaps we can make a trade.\""
msgstr ""

msgstr ""
msgid "A mercenary ship arrives at the beacon.  \"We have a bit of extra fuel we can give you... for a price.\""

msgstr ""
msgid "Your distress beacon must be working because a ship just jumped nearby. You run a scan on it and activate a red alert. It's a Rebel fighter!"
msgstr ""
msgid "A Rebel ship jumps in and hails you, \"I knew you would slip up some time. Surrender quietly!\""
msgstr ""
msgid "A ship responding to your distress moves in. Unfortunately it turns out to be an automated Rebel scout. It immediately reverses thrust after scanning your ship."

msgid "They clearly are busy because they don't notice your ship at all."

msgid "The Engies respond to your signal. \"Identity: Federation. I/O error: Federation = [void].\" All further hails go unanswered."
msgstr ""
msgid "The Engies fail to respond, but move to intercept. You detect abnormal electromagnetic signals aboard the ship - someone has reprogrammed these Engies to fight!"
msgstr ""
msgid "The Engies respond to your signal. \"Your need: fuel. This unit's need: scrap. Exchange beneficial. Exchange permitted?"
msgstr ""
msgid "Make the trade."

msgid "A Mantis ship hails you, \"Looks like we found the poor fools that need some help. Come brothers, let's 'help them!\" They move in to attack."
msgstr ""
msgid "Before long a ship jumps nearby, no doubt responding to your beacon. However any relief you felt disappears as soon as you recognize the ship is of Mantis design. Prepare for a fight."
msgstr ""
msgid "You detect a Mantis ship approaching and hack into their comm channel and hear, \"...hope they put up more of a fight than the last Federation ship. This has been a disappointing day so far.\" Looks like they're not here to help."
msgstr ""
msgid "A Mantis ship jump nearby. Sensors detect weapon locks and all hope of avoiding a fight fades away."
msgstr ""
msgid "As you await either salvation or death, your attention is drawn to a sea of debris drifting past the starboard view port. The chunks gliding by grow bigger in size until the stern of a Rock frigate, gutted in some distant war, comes into view."
msgstr ""
msgid "Send an away team."
msgstr ""
msgid "Perhaps there's some viable fuel left on board; a small away team boards the vessel."

msgstr ""
msgid "The team returns home rather sooner than expected. Turns out just as they were making entry to the frigate, the ship's emergency fuel cell just happened to drift by!"
msgstr ""
msgid "The away team reports in, but then screams are heard and the comm goes dead! When it comes back online a Rockman can be heard - he's the lone survivor from the frigate's crew, and completely mad. He demands you pay a scrap ransom in return for your crew-member's life!"
msgstr ""
msgid "Pay."
msgstr ""
msgid "Despite his fragile condition, the Rockman is good to his word and returns your crew-member, who is suitably grateful. Sadly, gratitude doesn't power the FTL drive."
msgstr ""
msgid "Refuse."
msgstr ""
msgid "It's a tough call, but it's for the Federation and the liberty of all. You set off before you can change your mind."
msgstr ""
msgid "A curious Rock ship comes in for a closer look at you. They refuse all hails."

msgid "Attack."
msgstr ""
msgid "The Rock people are not renowned for their generosity. If it's fuel you need, it's fuel you must take!"
msgstr ""
msgid "Wait and see."
msgstr ""
msgid "The Rock ship circles yours, running scans on your systems. You fear the worst, but the scans pause on your fuel tank. They obviously have no wish to communicate, but they transfer over a cache of fuel before flashing their lights and jumping away!"
msgstr ""
msgid "The Rock ship circles yours, running scans on your systems. Your worst fears are confirmed when they identify your engines and teleport a bomb straight onto it! Combat ready!"
msgstr ""
msgid "The ship jumps away without a word. You hope they didn't leave to get reinforcements."
msgstr ""
msgid "You take care to salvage as much fuel as possible from the wreck."

msgid "A poorly armed Slug ship cruises by and offers assistance. Their captain seems to be chuckling to himself, perhaps at the prices he's charging."
msgstr ""
msgid "Pay 15 scrap for 5 fuel."
msgstr ""
msgid "Ignore the offer."
msgstr ""
msgid "You know better than to do business with a Slugman who seems like he knows something you don't. He jumps off with another chuckle."
msgstr ""
msgid "(Slug Crew) Have your Slug make the purchase."
msgstr ""
msgid "As soon as he sees your crew member the Slug stops his incessant chuckling. The exchange appears to go smoothly although you wonder what mental battles are telepathically occurring between the two Slugs."
msgstr ""
msgid "You doubt he is trustworthy but have no choice but to make the deal. However you complete the exchange without event."
msgstr ""
msgid "Everything looks secure but suddenly a number of supplies disappear! He must have planted a portable teleporter into your cargo bay somehow. Before you can react his ship is long gone."
msgstr ""
msgid "A mobile Slugman fuel depot enters scanning range. \"My prices are fair, but I ask one thing - do not insult me with negotiation!\" You check out his price list."
msgstr ""
msgid "Buy 5 fuel for 50 scrap."
msgstr ""
msgid "The trader looks shocked. You're struck by the sense that this is the first time anyone's ever paid him these prices."
msgstr ""
msgid "Buy 10 fuel for 95 scrap. (BEST DEAL!)"
msgstr ""
msgid "Negotiate."
msgstr ""
msgid "You offer a more reasonable price but the Slugman is outraged! He moves in to attack!"
