msgstr ""
msgid "You cross paths with a Rock ship returning from a rare diplomatic mission. Equally surprising, the captain responds to your hails and agrees to a mutual trade."
msgstr ""
msgid "You come across a Rock trading post. It's rare they deal with outsiders, but they need to sell the last of their stock, and will pay their dues for their transgression when they return home."
msgstr ""
msgid "With the local Rock settlements so unwilling to trade with other life forms, an opportunistic Mantis crew has postponed its piracy activities and set up shop to catch any passing trade."
msgstr ""
msgid "The Rock tolerate few aliens in their space, but even they seem to respect the wisdom of the Zoltan - a few of them have established a trading post in the husk of an abandoned capital ship."
msgstr ""
msgid "You receive a hail on Federation frequencies: \"You're Federation?! We- we weren't sure we'd ever see a friendly face again. There's little business here, perhaps you'd like to trade?\""

msgid "You receive a message meant to degrade you as aliens. You half expect an attack but it seems to have come from a small civilian shuttle."

msgid "No one bothers your ship as you float among numerous space stations and mining platforms. The Rock certainly run efficient operations."

msgid "A few freighters pass by but they refuse all communications. Must not want to sully their reputation by talking with foreigners."

msgid "You see a small trading post and ask about refuelling but they respond, \"Go away! We don't serve your kind here.\""

msgid "You see a Zoltan merchant and ask about his wares. He responds, \"Sorry, but it took years to gain their trust. I can't be seen communicating with you. I hope you understand.\" He cuts communications."

msgid "As you jump in, a vast figure appears on the view-screen. The Rock captain rubs the green, moss-like appendage on his chin and then orders his crew to open fire."
msgstr ""
msgid "It looks quiet, but you realize your computer is being scanned. A hidden Rock vessel hails you: \"Why do you fill your computer with lies?! These are not the holy words!\" Before you can interject they open fire."
msgstr ""
msgid "You notice a Rock ship performing combat exercises. However, they quickly change their course to engage your ship. They apparently treat unregistered alien ships as handy target practice."
msgstr ""
msgid "A loud 'thud' resounds through the ship after jump completion - you've just shunted a Rock fighter and he's already preparing to fire!"
msgstr ""
msgid "You're intercepted by a Rock salvage operation. They don't seem to mind that you're still on board while they junk your ship."

msgid "The Rock ship hails: \"Enough! We were told aliens were a threat to our ways, and you have proved as much. Take this and leave us in peace.\""
msgstr ""
msgid "Their systems suffering, the Rock ship attempts to make contact: \"Alien vessel. Cease your attack. We will pay.\""
msgstr ""
msgid "The Rock ship moves into a defensive position and transmits a white flag signal. They seem willing to buy their lives."
msgstr ""
msgid "As a naturally warlike species with few inter-galactic diplomatic ties, the Rock people have garnered quite a reputation as fearsome pirates. You stumble across one of their ships and they promptly live up to type."
msgstr ""
msgid "A Rock ship flies past your windows and you recognise outcast decorations on the hull. These must be pirates!"

msgid "Before you have a chance to leave, a Rock patrol ship arrives and you intercept their comm chatter, \"...appears we've finally found them. Their killing spree ends now!\" Before you can plead your innocence they move in to attack."
msgstr ""
msgid "You salvage what you can from the ship. No lifeforms or ships are detected nearby."
msgstr ""
msgid "You begin the salvage operation but before long your crew warns you of an approaching ship. You hasten to leave before they get within firing range."
msgstr ""
msgid "Fluctuating life-signs are reported near the surface of a hazy, pock-marked moon in the vicinity. It seems this is a Rock nursery where the young are 'acclimatized' to their religion - only there's been some kind of coup and the students are running amok!"
msgstr ""
msgid "Transfer an away team to investigate."
msgstr ""
msgid "Your away team reports combat between students and authorities - it seems some of the students were considered to have dissident personalities and were to be imprisoned pro-actively."

msgid "You dispatch a barrage of weapons fire that crashes home into an unused quarry near to the installation. Weapons fire on the surface ceases for as long as it takes for the moon's defense force to be dispatched to your location!"
msgstr ""
msgid "Things, in the end, do not go well. The enemy succeeds in flanking your team and they're forced to retreat to the ship."
msgstr ""
msgid "The staff and authorities subdue the last of the renegade students; prison transport ships are already in orbit."
msgstr ""
msgid "The fight goes poorly, and your team eventually finds itself out on the flank with a wounded Rock combatant in tow. They make a desperate push for the shuttle co-ordinates, but one falls. The survivor helps the injured Rock aboard."
msgstr ""
msgid "Your team hunkers down in the main quad and succeeds in holding off the enemy combatants and claiming control of the institution!"
msgstr ""
msgid "The students secure the remaining staff and prepare to leave the solar system - there is only one path open to them now, that of the outlaw."
msgstr ""
msgid "Your team comes under heavy fire. One is blinded by a flash bomb and staggers past the lip of a quarry and to their death far below; the other succeeds in joining with friendly forces and ultimately claims control of the institution!"
msgstr ""
msgid "As the battle proceeds the action moves away from your team's location. During the lull they're able to secure some abandoned weapons; by the time they're done the battle is largely over and they return to ship."
msgstr ""
msgid "In return for your support during the fight the survivors reward you with the funds set aside for prison transport. You leave before anyone changes their mind!"
msgstr ""
msgid "Fully aware that their victory was threatened by your arrival, the survivors immediately dispatch a ship to eliminate you!"
msgstr ""
msgid "A Mantis ship here is adorned with Rock body parts! It would be a gorier display if they had internal organs, but the message is clear enough: this is a hunter of a very specialised kind."
msgstr ""
msgid "Attack!"
msgstr ""
msgid "No species deserves a Mantis hunter on their back - time to make the galaxy a little safer. Engage!"
msgstr ""
msgid "Ignore them."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""
msgid "(Rock Ship) Ram the bastards."
msgstr ""
msgid "Before they have a chance, you ram your ship into theirs causing irreparable damage to their engines. Luckily your ships armored hull is hardly dented from the impact. The Mantis ship careens away and you move in to attack."
msgstr ""
msgid "(Rock Crew) Put your Rock crew member on the comm."
msgstr ""
msgid "The two aliens face one another over the vidscreen. \"Cave-dwelling pebble-man!\" yells the furious Mantis captain. \"See, I paint my ship with your companions! I paint my ship with you!\""

msgid "A curious sight greets you at this beacon: a disabled Rock freighter drifts in space while two Mantis craft battle it out - presumably over who deserves the spoils."
msgstr ""
msgid "Wait, then attack the surviving Mantis."
msgstr ""
msgid "There's quite enough action here already - prepare for light speed."
msgstr ""
msgid "(Repair Drone) Repair the Rock ship."
msgstr ""
msgid "While the two Mantis fight you approach the Rock ship and send a repair drone through one of the many breaches. It fixes the ship up enough to make at least a single jump. You're surprised when, instead, they embark on a kamikaze run on the two Mantis, which results in the obliteration of all three!"
msgstr ""
msgid "(Hull Repair Drone) Repair their hull."
msgstr ""
msgid "While the two Mantis fight you approach the Rock ship and use a drone to fix up the ship. Once the breaches are fixed the life support flickers back on. In a matter of moments they are already in pursuit of one of the Mantis ships. Meanwhile the second Mantis turns toward you."
msgstr ""
msgid "The Mantis craft are both too busy slaughtering one another to notice you. Eventually the smaller ship gets the upper hand when it overrides the enemy door system and flushes the crew into space. Now's the time!"
msgstr ""
msgid "The Mantis craft may have their differences, but when it comes to you they are of one mind. The smaller ship suffers a power failure as it moves to engage, but the larger one lets off a volley of fire and moves in to attack!"
msgstr ""
msgid "In the time it took you to eliminate the Mantis ship the Rock must have repaired their FTL drive and jumped away. You pick the bones of both Mantis vessels."
msgstr ""
msgid "It seems a Zoltan ship came here to liberate a Rock settlement from their 'oppressive belief system', and that said Rock did not appreciate it - long-range scanners suggest the Zoltan and their pursuers  will be here at any moment!"
msgstr ""
msgid "Stay and defend the Zoltan."
msgstr ""
msgid "The... extreme nature of Rock faith is well-known; the Zoltan can hardly be blamed for trying to broaden their horizons. The pursuing Rock ship quickly assesses the situation and decides two captured alien ships are better than one."
msgstr ""
msgid "Stay and capture the Zoltan."
msgstr ""
msgid "This is Rock territory, and therefore Rock law - the Zoltan should have known better than to interfere. You'll have to disable their engines and piloting to ensure their safe capture."
msgstr ""
msgid "This is none of your concern - power up the jump drive!"
msgstr ""
msgid "The Rock ship's hull breaks apart. You salvage the wreck before contacting the Zoltan ship."
msgstr ""
msgid "The Zoltan show little emotion, but express their gratitude with a small payment."
msgstr ""
msgid "With the ship's crew dead you salvage the ship before contacting the Zoltans."
msgstr ""
msgid "The Rock ship arrives just as you put the finishing blows to the Zoltan ship. They're not of a mind to thank you, and you get the impression it'd be best if you left post haste.."
msgstr ""
msgid "By the time the Rock ship arrives you've all but tied a bow around their quarry. The injured and dying Zoltan are easily taken into custody and the Rock ship grudgingly transfers over what you assume must be the bounty."
msgstr ""
msgid "You encounter a small craft with minimal propulsion; its Rock crew-member explains that the Rock home-world is run on lies and propaganda that keep the populace in check, and that they want no part of it."
msgstr ""
msgid "Tell them their god sent them here to join your crew."
msgstr ""
msgid "Promise to share with them the truths they've been denied."
msgstr ""
msgid "(Improved Sensors) Show them to your data suite."
msgstr ""
msgid "The Rock captain is impressed by the data you've collected and agrees to stay with you until they find their footing in the galaxy."
msgstr ""
msgid "They barely hear out your appeals before yelling, \"These are the lies I sought to escape!\" Looks like they're charging weapons!"
msgstr ""
msgid "They listen to your appeals and whisper, \"Traitors to truth. You're no better than them!\" Chaos ensues."
msgstr ""
msgid "Your promises gain their attention and they agree to serve with you, for a while."
msgstr ""
msgid "They seem tempted by your offer, but decide they can't risk being lied to again. They close frequencies and jump away."
msgstr ""
msgid "The burnt out hull of a Rock mine layer drifts by. Behind the wreck drifts a live mine; an automated drone that drills into ships' hulls before exploding. It locks onto your ship's signature and heads your way!"
msgstr ""
msgid "Attempt evasive maneuvers."
msgstr ""
msgid "The ship's turning circle proves too wide and the mine bites down onto the hull. You can hear it now, chewing through the armour."
msgstr ""
msgid "Send someone out there to defuse it."
msgstr ""
msgid "(Missile Weapon) Attempt a controlled detonation using a missile."
msgstr ""
msgid "After drawing straws, a crew member goes out to fix a modified warhead to the mine.  You detonate the missile in a way that dislodges the mine. It blows up shortly after. The ship takes some damage in the blasts, but you're still sailing."
msgstr ""
msgid "(Beam Drone) Use a drone to cut away the mine with a precision beam."
msgstr ""
msgid "Carefully guided from the bridge, your beam drone removes the mine's grappling arms and sends it drifting off into space, where you shoot at it until it detonates at a safe distance."
msgstr ""
msgid "(Improved Engines) Reverse thrusters!"
msgstr ""
msgid "It stresses the inertial dampeners, but you reverse course and outrun the mine. You prepare to jump off."
msgstr ""
msgid "Your crew-member dons a space suit and exits the airlock. They make quick work of the basic device and return inside to relief all round. The mine makes good scrap pickings too."
msgstr ""
msgid "Your crew-member dons a space suit and exits the airlock. When they open up the mine housing, though, they panic. The red wire or the blue?! 3... 2... 1..."
msgstr ""
msgid "Red!"
msgstr ""
msgid "Blue!"
msgstr ""
msgid "You open your eyes and everything is still where it was a moment ago. You did it!"
msgstr ""
msgid "The weapon detonates. Everything goes dark, the bridge illuminated by flames pouring from the hull, your bomb disposal volunteer spinning off toward a nearby sun. You put out the fires and prepare to move on."
msgstr ""
msgid "A Rock mining vessel is harvesting the mineral-rich asteroids in this locality, and their scouts take your presence to be a transgression.  Battle stations!"
msgstr ""
msgid "A rookie Rock cargo ship has taken its orders too literally and took the most direct route to their destination... right through an asteroid field. They're confused and fire wildly as you jump in."
msgstr ""
msgid "The captain of a Rock freighter lost in the asteroid field hails you: \"Our co-ordinates led us here, but only death greets us. What must be must be. Death to all.\" You power up the battle systems and wonder how long they've been stuck here."
msgstr ""
msgid "Minute fissures in the shields spark and crackle as the ship jumps into the wake of a huge asteroid. More asteroids follow, as does a lost and aggressive Rock pirate ship."
msgstr ""
msgid "You exit the jump surrounded by dirt and rocks. Before long a blast is deflected by your shield, but that was no asteroid... Incoming pirate!"
msgstr ""
msgid "Unusual solar activity in this region means you need to get out, quick. The Rock pirate nearby apparently thinks otherwise as they move to attack your ship."
msgstr ""
msgid "A Rock ship is silhouetted against a sun in supernova. They hail: \"Even out here you follow us! We only wish to be left alone!\" Out of panic or anger, they charge their weapons."
msgstr ""
msgid "A Rock captain hails you: \"It is improper of me to contact off-worlders, but this is an emergency. We were on our way to deliver our passenger to her new husband - the Grand Basilisk of Numa V - when our engines broke down. Will you take possession of her and make haste to Numa V?\""
msgstr ""
msgid "Accept the passenger."
msgstr ""
msgid "\"You surprise me, off-worlder. Thank you. The passenger will be with you momentarily.\" She refuses to enter the main hold and prefers to wait in the cargo bay."

msgid "Refuse."
msgstr ""
msgid "Arranged marriages aren't on your list of worthy causes. You leave the Rock to their business."
msgstr ""
msgid "A vast tunnel network near the surface of Numa V indicates an advanced Rock civilization. This must be where you were asked to deliver the passenger."
msgstr ""
msgid "Realizing arrival is imminent, the passenger - silent so far - pleads with you not to hand her over. She's interrupted by the Grand Basilisk's Chief Aid: \"To the alien vessel holding the Basilisk's wife. Deliver her to us. You will be rewarded... well.\""
msgstr ""
msgid "Hand her over."
msgstr ""
msgid "\"May your children erode into dust!\" she screams as she's bundled into the waiting shuttle. The Rock guards on board hurriedly drop off an exotic piece of technology and return to the Grand Basilisk."

msgid "\"I was led to believe your kind did not know mercy. I will join you. But quickly, we must jump away - they will not tolerate...\" She's interrupted by weapons fire from the Basilisk's escort!"

msgid "His escort eliminated, the Grand Basilisk dispatches his entire fleet. There's just time to take your pick from the wreck before you jump out of their reach."
msgstr ""
msgid "You passively scan a small Rock station that is next to the beacon. However they must not have appreciated your curiosity. A Rock ship pulls away from the station and you register an incoming teleporter signal as well!"
msgstr ""
msgid "You find a Rock ship docked with a damaged Mantis fighter. Before you have a chance to hail them, the ship moves in to attack you and you register teleporter symbols from the disabled ship. They're using Mantis tech to board you!"
msgstr ""
msgid "You arrive in an asteroid field and immediately begin evasive maneuvers when a loud clunk reverberates through the ship. At first you think the hull has been hit but the noise came from some Rock intruders teleporting aboard the ship!"

msgid "Your shields are being taxed as the they deflect the debris from an asteroid field. As you weave your way between the rocks you happen upon a Rock pirate stronghold. You register teleport signatures and hear shouts aboard the ship."
msgstr ""
msgid "As soon as you arrive you hear the telltale sounds of a teleporter and shouts reverberating through the ship, \"Prepare to burn, fleshy meat-sack aliens!\""
msgstr ""
msgid "With their high resistance to heat, outlaw Rocks often settle very close to stars. That is why it is hardly surprising when your ship gets boarded as you stumble past a hidden settlement."
